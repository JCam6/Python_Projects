## A Brief History Of Python

This landing page provides new and beginner users with an overview of the Python Programming language. This overview will explore the origins of Python, changes that have occurred over time, involvement from leading developers, important programming features, emerging use in scientific areas, and a future outlook for the programming language.

**Language Origins**

Python appears to most new and beginner users as a programming language that must have been introduced in the last five or ten years. However, the origins of Python date back to the early 1990s. Guido van Rossum is a Dutch computer scientist who began his career at a research center in Amsterdam (CWI) with the focus of developing a new operating system. The operating system's development was severely hindered by the use of C programming. Van Rossum nurtured the idea that a more efficient solution was possible. In December 1989, he began a project at home to develop a programming language that was marginally based on a high-level data processing language (ABC) that was the focus of a previous project team in which he was a junior programmer.

**Historical Changes**

The initial version releases of Python benefited from the collaboration of a large community of individuals due to its nature as an open-source programming language. Early on, Van Rossum collaborated with other computer scientists that were working on different procedural programming languages such as Modula 2 and Modula 3 which were primarily designed for research. While interacting with Modula programmers, he confirmed the idea that extensibility through modules was very important to the development of Python. Van Rossum continued to nurture an interactive relationship with users and he personally implemented many of their suggestions into revised versions and subsequent minor releases of Python.

In October of 2000, the release of Python 2.0 was published to the development community. The most significant features included in the 2.0 release were: the new Unicode data type with supporting functions and modules, list comprehensions, augmented assignment operators, string manipulation methods, and more efficient garbage collection of unneeded code elements (Kuchling & Zadka, 2000). As expected, several other small changes were included in the 2.0 release to improve functionality and efficiency. 

In December of 2008, Python generation 3.0 was released and was notably not backward compatible with prior releases. Important advances to the fundamental use of Python required the 3.0 release to be incompatible with prior versions. The changes and feature additions are too lengthy to list here as they significantly modified the code structure. The improvements included in the initial Python 3.0 release yielded a minor detriment to the overall speed of code execution when compared to minor releases of 2.0 (Rossum, 2009). With a current version of 3.9, development continues to expand the successful adoption of Python into a wide array of user communities.

**Developer Involvement**

One of the first instrumental developers to provide a significant contribution to Python is Tim Peters. He was originally introduced to the Python programming language early in the 1990s by a colleague while he was working exclusively with C programming (Computer History Museum, 2018). Since that time, Peters has been very instrumental in guiding the core development in a thoughtful way that utilizes his background and knowledge of C programming. The most well-known publication of Tim Peters is "The Zen of Python" (PEP 20). In this publication, Peters embodies the ethos of simplicity which is the essence of why the programming language was first created and continues to be the leading strategy for future development. A full presentation of The Zen of Python's list of 19 statements is accessible in the standard IDLE (and also other IDE's) with the simple syntax of "import this".

Other leading computer scientists have provided major contributions to the vast array of over 100,000 Python libraries. These contributions have been especially impactful in the area of data analysis and scientific research with the Numpy library that was created by Travis Oliphant and the Matplotlib library that was created by John Hunter.

**Important Features**

The most important feature of the Python programming language is extensibility which provides the ability to add new functionality through libraries, modules, and packages. These extensions allow Python to be utilized in a wide spectrum of professional fields. Data science extensions are possibly the most well-known in Python but a large assortment of libraries, packages, and modules exist for other subjects such as social media, bioinformatics, networking, cybersecurity, web design, operating system utilities, financial analysis, and geospatial analysis (Hattingh, 2016). 

Programmer productivity through several other key features has allowed Python to become adored by many developers. The other key features include readability, statement grouping through indentation, and dynamic typing. Ease of learning is a resulting consequence of these features in addition to the productivity granted to programmers.

**Application Utility**

As previously noted, the most essential feature of Python is its extensibility through libraries, modules, and packages. A large assortment of libraries, packages, and modules exist for Python to be useful in such areas as social media, bioinformatics, networking, cybersecurity, web design, operating system utilities, financial analysis, and geospatial analysis (Hattingh, 2016). The most popular social media websites that are designed for photo sharing, blogging, shopping, and music streaming are built with back-end code written in Python. 

**Future Outlook**

Python has become the leading programming language for many emerging professional areas. This is especially true for the field of cybersecurity. Many of the programs that execute computer security commands are usually written in shell syntax such as Bash for Linux or PowerShell for Windows. Python modules and libraries now allow these same commands to be executed more efficiently and capture of the results for incorporation into more sophisticated programs.

An opportunity to transform cybersecurity-related programming exists due to the noted developments of libraries and modules in Python. It is very rational to expect programming in cybersecurity communities to follow a path similar to that of data analysis and scientific research. Network infrastructure modeling can eventually develop to a level similar to Matplotlib. Future functionality may require minimal or no input from the user to return a graphical display of network topology. Security vulnerability assessment can potentially develop to a level similar to Numpy. Forthcoming operability may require only a target IP address to return specific system vulnerabilities. Python scripts designed to achieve these goals already exist in the public domain. The next step for the manual scripts will be full modules and libraries that expand popularity and simplify use.
